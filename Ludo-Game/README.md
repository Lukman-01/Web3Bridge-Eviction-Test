# Ludo Smart Contract

## Overview

The **Ludo** smart contract is a decentralized implementation of the classic board game, Ludo, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Players can roll a virtual dice and move their positions on a 52-space board, simulating the gameplay of Ludo in a trustless environment.

## Features

- **Dice Rolling**: Players can roll a virtual dice to get a number between 1 and 6 using a secure random number generation method based on block data.
- **Player Movement**: Players can move their positions on the board according to the result of the dice roll.
- **Event Emission**: The contract emits an event whenever a player moves, providing transparency and tracking of player actions.

## Technologies

- **Solidity Version**: 0.8.17
- **Network**: Ethereum-compatible network (can be deployed on Ethereum testnets/mainnet)
- **Tools**:
  - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
  - Any Ethereum-compatible block explorer (e.g., Etherscan)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lukman-01/Web3Bridge-Eviction-Test.git
   cd Ludo-Game
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file (if needed):
   ```
   ETH_RPC_URL=your-ethereum-rpc-url
   PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
   ```

4. Compile the smart contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. Deploy the contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.ts --network lisk-sepolia --verify
   ```
